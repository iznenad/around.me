About
=====

around.me is project i started to get familiar with Ember.js, Node.js, mongodb and a couple other JS tecnologies.

In a couple of words it represents location based twitter. Users posts are visible only to people who are phisicaly near to the user.

That's it.


Notes about starting it up
==========================

You have to configure the absolute path to the frontend folder so that the server will know where it is.

Also by default the mongo instance is assumed to be running on the default port on localhost.
